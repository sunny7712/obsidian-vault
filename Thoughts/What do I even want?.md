Things feel exciting when I see someone do them. Be it a good piece of software that someone built, or a difficult course that someone completed or even art that someone created. The skill that people possess do such things seems very attractive. Naturally, there's a dopamine kick to start that thing. The goal sets in, to achieve the same level of competentness in the domain. But the problem here is, all that excitement and motivation vanish at the first sight of difficulty while pursuing the goal. From here on, it feels like hard work. Novelty fades. Mind and body struggle to push through. "There are fun things to spend time on. Why this struggle?" shouts the mind. The fact it takes a lot of practice and time to even start seeing minor results makes it even the more unappealing to pursue. The path you have to go to complete the task seems daunting now. The journey feels overwhelming. Questions start to pop up. "Is this even worth it?", "Will this be useful to me?"
