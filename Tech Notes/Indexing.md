- An index is any data structure that improves the performance of lookup. There are many different [data structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Data_structures "Category:Data structures") used for this purpose.
-  There are complex design trade-offs involving lookup performance, index size, and index-update performance. Many index designs exhibit logarithmic ([O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation "Big O notation")(log(N))) lookup performance and in some applications it is possible to achieve flat ([O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation "Big O notation")(1)) performance.
