1. Rolling Returns: Comparing returns over different periods to ensure consistency.
2. Compare with category average and benchmarks.
3. Sharpe Ratio: Evaluates returns in relation to the risk taken (returns divided by standard deviation). 
4. Beta: Measures the fund's volatility relative to the benchmark (e.g., Nifty). 
5. Capture Ratios: Includes upside capture ratio (fund's performance in rising markets) and downside capture ratio (fund's performance in falling markets). 
6. AUM (Assets Under Management): Often misconceived as a sole indicator of a good fund, but it should not be the primary factor. 
7. Total Expense Ratio (TER): The fee charged by the mutual fund company, which should be reasonable compared to others in the category.
