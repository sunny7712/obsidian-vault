Worked on:
- Analyzed performance of yesterday's parquet file ingestion with the help of prometheus metrics (promQL)
- Fixed timezone related bugs in the read query of duckdb
- Stuck on a indices read bug (INDIA VIX). Found out a case with the help of Gaurav regarding indices symbol names that needs to be handled.
