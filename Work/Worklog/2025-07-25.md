Worked on:
1. Uploading a few files from prod bucket to stage bucket through a controller for testing.
2. Written functionality (code and SQL query) to consume parquet files from bucket, partition them into directories according to our liking and dump them to PV.
3. Stuck on a case of not able to download a duckDB extension on stage pod.
4. Discussed with Gaurav and sumit regarding this. Gaurav mentioned a few ways to get around this. Will try them out.
