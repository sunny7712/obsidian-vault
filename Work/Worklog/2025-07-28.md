Worked on:
- Added tests for the read layer of candle data in adapter. Got the PR merged.
- Tried the docker approach for loading the extension for reading gcs file from parquet through duckdb. Didn't work as we needed HMAC credentials (key and id).
- Working on directly ingesting files from GCP through gcs client and loading in memory.
