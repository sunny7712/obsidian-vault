1. Can you point out specific situations or patterns where you noticed gaps in my skills, knowledge, or approach—especially regarding technical depth, problem-solving, or communication—and how can I effectively address these gaps?
2. Looking at my current role and responsibilities, what are the most important competencies or mindsets I should develop in the next 3–6 months to become more self-sufficient and take on a higher level of ownership?
3. Are there any typical mistakes or blind spots that you’ve observed in junior engineers (including me) that I should be aware of and consciously work to avoid or overcome?
4. What are the most significant strengths you have observed in my work during the past three months, both technically and professionally, and how can I further build on these strengths?
