- Groww's logo is looking a bit weird in the subtext below cloud. 
- On the documentation page, the `Add Project` button must be `Add Strategy`. Do we really need this top right hand section?
- In the Upload script dialog box, replace the `Enter Project name` to `Enter Strategy name`.
  
### API Key and secret dialog box
- Normal API key flow (6 AM expiry) should also be supported along with API key and secret on the dialog box.

### API token dashboard
- Status section in the api token dashboard, doesn't make any sense, as the tokens are long living.
- In the important note, the note should be something like "All Access tokens generated by these API keys will expire daily at 6 AM. Do not share your Acess tokens or api keys..."
- `Approve all tokens` button can be skipped?
- Is it necessary to show time to expiry if all the tokens are expired?
### Delete API key dialog box
- The prompt must be "Are you sure you want to delete the API key". There must also be a subtext "Access token generated by this key will also be revoked".  "This key cannot be retrieved once deleted"

### TOTP Token dialog box
- The title must be "TOTP" instead of "TOTP token"
- The text inside the name box can be "Enter a name for this key"
- There must be a note "Scan this QR in your Authenticator app"
