- Optimize processes and increase throughput using one resource -> **Vertical Scaling**
- Preparing beforehand during non peak hours -> **Preprocessing & Cron jobs**
- Keep backups and **avoid single points of failures** -> **Backups**
- Add more resources -> **Horizontal Scaling**
- Routing your requests to different services designed to handle that specific type of requests and keeping the responsibilities separate -> **Microservices**
- Keeping multiple instances of your system on servers all around the world to serve traffic across the world -> **Distributed systems (Partitioning)**
- A central authority which routes requests to different server instances based on some business logic -> **Load balancer**
- Separation of concerns -> **Decoupling**
- Metrics, traces and logs -> **Observability**
- **Extensible**
